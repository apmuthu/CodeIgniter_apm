CodeIgniter_apm
===============
* This (v2.2 branch only) is forked from the [Official CI GitHub Repo](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter) at [v2.1.4](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/archive/2.1.4.tar.gz) | [Alternate download site](https://ellislab.com/asset/ci_download_files/CodeIgniter_2.1.4.zip)
* The copyright header in possibly every file causes real changes across versions to be difficult to discern and hence this fork.
* The `application/config/config.php` file should actually be `config.php.tmpl` so as not to overwrite your working `config.php` file.
* Official support from the developers is till 2015-10-31.
* This version is tested with PHP 5.1.6, 5.3.1, 5.3.3 on Windows ( [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org) ) and Debian.
* Most if not all changes in the user guide are only in version number.
* Where possible, whitespace changes have been consolidated into separate commits.
